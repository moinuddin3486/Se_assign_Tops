â€¢ What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

Ans :
                
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data in the form of fields (attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (methods or functions). The main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Here's a brief explanation of each:

            Encapsulation: This is the bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionalities.

            Inheritance: create new class by exist

            Polymorphism: One Name Multiple Forms

            Abstraction:For Data Hiding

            No Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes
